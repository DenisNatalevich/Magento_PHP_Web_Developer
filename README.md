## Objective

To obtain a challenging and rewarding senior magento web developer position where I can utilize my knowledge, proficiency, and skills to contribute to a company's growth.

## Work experience

### Acidgreen Pty Ltd (April 2008 - Present), Senior Web Developer
- I was employed as web developer and took no long to reach the position of senior web developer.
- Being one of the experienced staff, most difficult projects end up to my project list which I enjoy as I always love challenges.
- I was lead developer for one of our biggest magento client Binglee at acidgreen.
- Since Binglee, we have been getting lots of large magento projects, and I have been involved with almost all of them in developing and deploying to live.
- I have developed magento projects from scratch to production alone. So I can do both backend and frontend. I was not only coding backend, I was slicing PSDs and converting them to PHTML for magento frontend.
- I used to install magento on local environment and staging. After testing on local, I used to push on staging for client's review. Once everything was completed and approved, I used to copy staging site to production.
- We were using git to track all the changes and version the release.
- We had Capistrano to automate deployment of latest release to production and staging.
- I have created few magento extensions which runs in many sites.
- You can find some of my magento extensions on my github repository at - https://github.com/dbashyal


### Visiontech Digital Media (Jan 2007 - April 2008), Web Developer
- Started as a Junior Web Developer but exceeded everyone's expectation to drop Junior from title.
- At this job I was doing 90% of the development work being only developer after development manager.
- I had to work with clients to get their feedback and apply those updates.
